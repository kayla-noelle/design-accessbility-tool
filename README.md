# Design Accessbility Tool

Currently working on developing a tool for designers where they can check the level of accessbility in their design choices. Leading them to create an even more accessible and better UI components!


#CURRENT UPDATE:
I added in the color inputs and the live preview. At the moment you are able to click the colors for your background, heading, text, and button.

I plan to add in a section where it will tell where your color choices fall on the accessbility scale.
